## Advanced Scenarios (Extended Prompts)

Beyond the standard 8-phase workflow, use these extended prompts for deeper security analysis:

### Scenario 1: Complete Interface & Data Flow Discovery

Comprehensive discovery and risk analysis of all system interfaces.

```
Perform complete interface and data flow discovery analysis on this repository:

1. Comprehensive discovery of all system interfaces:
   - User interaction interfaces (Web UI, CLI, Mobile)
   - External APIs (REST, GraphQL, gRPC, WebSocket)
   - System interfaces (File system, Database, Message queue)
   - Internal services (Microservice calls, RPC, Event bus)

2. Build complete data flow diagram:
   - Annotate all data entry and exit points
   - Identify sensitive data flow paths
   - Mark trust boundary crossing points

3. Risk analysis for each interface:
   - Input validation risks
   - Authentication/authorization risks
   - Data leakage risks
   - Injection attack risks

Output format: Complete interface inventory sorted by risk level, with CWE mapping and CVSS scores
```

### Scenario 2: Attack Tree, POC Generation & Pentest Plan

Deep attack chain analysis with exploit POC generation and penetration testing plan.

```
Perform deep attack analysis on this repository with debug mode:

Based on discovered security issues, perform deep attack analysis:

1. Attack tree construction:
   - Build attack tree for each high-risk threat
   - Analyze attack prerequisites and dependencies
   - Calculate attack success probability and impact scope

2. Attack chain analysis:
   - Identify multi-step attack paths (Initial Access → Execution → Persistence → Exfiltration)
   - Map to MITRE ATT&CK tactics and techniques
   - Mark critical pivot points in attack chain

3. Exploit POC generation:
   - Generate POC code for each exploitable vulnerability
   - Include payload construction, trigger conditions, expected results
   - Provide safe testing methods (avoid destructive operations)

4. Penetration testing plan:
   | Issue ID | Vulnerability | Test Case | Test Steps | POC | Recommended Tools |
   |----------|---------------|-----------|------------|-----|-------------------|

Output: Complete penetration testing plan document, ready for security testing execution
```

### Scenario 3: Docker Test Environment & Automated Verification

Set up isolated test environment and execute penetration testing plan.

```
Set up test environment and execute penetration test verification for this repository:

1. Environment analysis:
   - Parse project's docker-compose.yml / Dockerfile
   - Identify required service dependencies (database, cache, message queue)
   - Analyze default configuration and environment variables

2. Docker test environment construction:
   - Generate isolated test environment docker-compose.test.yml
   - Configure network isolation and port mapping
   - Prepare test data and initialization scripts
   - Integrate security testing tool containers (OWASP ZAP, Nuclei, SQLMap)

3. Automated test execution:
   - Execute generated penetration testing plan
   - Collect test results and evidence screenshots
   - Verify vulnerability exploitability

4. Test report:
   - Vulnerability confirmation status (Confirmed / Not Exploitable / False Positive)
   - Actual risk assessment adjustment
   - Reproduction steps and evidence chain

Output: Test environment config files + Automated test scripts + Test results report
```

### Scenario 4: Attack Chain Visualization & POC Optimization

Comprehensive attack chain analysis with visualization and optimized exploitation.

```
Complete attack chain analysis and visualization for this repository with debug mode:

1. Attack graph construction:
   - Build complete system attack graph
   - Nodes: Assets, vulnerabilities, attack techniques
   - Edges: Attack paths, prerequisites, success probability

2. Critical path analysis:
   - Identify shortest attack path (from entry to core assets)
   - Identify highest success rate path
   - Identify attack chain with maximum impact scope

3. POC optimization combination:
   - Tool chain optimization (Recon → Exploit → Post-Exploit)
   - Automated attack script generation
   - One-click vulnerability verification workflow

4. Visualization output:
   - Mermaid format attack tree diagram
   - Attack path heatmap
   - Risk-impact matrix diagram
   - ATT&CK Navigator mapping
